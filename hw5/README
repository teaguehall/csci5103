Compilation Instructions:
-----------------------

Just run "make" to create the scullbuffer.ko and the producer/consumer programs.

Running Instructions:
-----------------------
1. Make sure that the device is unloaded or the device with same name doesn't
   exist. Type "sudo ./scull_unload".

2. Load the scull buffer using command "sudo ./scull_load". This will create
   a device called /dev/scullbuffer.

3. Change permissions on this device
   sudo chmod 777 /dev/scullbuffer

4. In case the number of items have to be specified by the user then type 
   "sudo ./scull_load nitems=<nitems>"

5. Type make command to compile all relevant files.

6. The test cases are present in a file called testcase.sh. 
   This script takes the test case number as the parameter. To execute a test
   case type "./testcase.sh <testcasenumber>".

Output Format:
----------------

1. The producers each write the item they have produced into their respective
   log files. 

2. The log file of a producer has the following format: Prod<third-arg>.log where
   the <third-arg> is the parameter passed to the producer which is the name of
   item that a particular producer will produce. For example: if producer writes
   items called "blue" then its output would be in file Prodblue.log.

3. The consumers each write the item they have consumed into their respective log files.
   The log file of a consumer has the following format: Cons<second-arg>.log
   where <second-arg> is the parameter passed to the consumer program which is
   an id entifier for a consumer. This argument must be unique per consumer.

Test Case Description:
-----------------------

The script file named "testcase" can be use for running your test, or you may type the commands yourself.
    Example:  ./testcase 1
        or    ./testcase 2   
       etc

Before running the testcases make sure to set permission on /dev/scullbuffer as shown below:
    
       sudo chmod 777 /dev/scullbuffer

1. 	Testcase #1: 
	-------------

	This test case consists of a single producer consumer each of which
	produce and consume 50 items respectively.
   
   	Expected Output: 
	----------------

	The producer and consumer must exit normally and the consumer must
	consume all the 50 items.
   
	Running instructions: 
	----------------------
	
	Type "./testcase.sh 1" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in file Prod_case1_red.log and the consumer output can be
	seen in the file Cons_case1.log.

2. 	Testcase #2: 
	-------------

	This test case consists of a single producer and consumer. The producer
	will try to produce 50 items before exiting and the consumer consumes
	only 10 items and exits. 
   
	Expected Output: 
	-----------------

	Depending on the size of the scull buffer the producer can deposit
	scull_b_nr_items + 10 items into the scull buffer and exit once the
	consumer exits. The consumer will read 10 items and exit.
   
	Running Instructions:
	----------------------

	Type "./testcase.sh 2" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in file Prod_case2_red.log and the consumer output can be
	seen in the file Cons_case2.log.

3.	Testcase #3:
	-------------

	This test case consists of a single producer and consumer. The producer
	produces 50 items before exiting and the consumer consumes 100 items
	before exiting.

	Expected Output:
	-----------------

	The producer will write 50 items into the scull buffer regardless of the
	scull buffer size. The consumer will consumer 50 items before exiting
	since there are no producers.

	Running Instructions:
	----------------------

	Type "./testcase.sh 3" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in file Prod_case3_red.log and the consumer output can be
	seen in the file Cons_case3.log.

4.	Testcase #4:
	-------------

	This test consists of two producers and one consumer. Each producer
	produces 50 items and the consumer will try to consumer 200 items
	before exiting.

	Expected Output:
	-----------------

	Both the items will produce 50 items regardless of the scullbuffer
	size and the consumer will exit after consuming 100 items.

	Running Instructions:
	----------------------

	Type "./testcase.sh 4" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in file Prod_case4_red.log and Prod_case4_black.log. The
	consumer output can be seen in Cons_case4.log.

5.	Testcase #5:
	------------

	This test consists of one producer and two consumers. The producer
	will produce 50 items and the two consumers together (or individuall)
	will consume the 50 items.

	Expected Output:
	----------------

	The producer will produce 50 items regardless of the scullbuffer size.
	The consumers will consumer variable number of items that add upto 50
	items combined.

	Running Instructions:
	---------------------

	Type "./testcase.sh 5" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in the file Prod_case5_red.log. The consumers output can be
	seen in the two log files Cons_case5_1.log and Cons_case5_2.log.
