This submission contains several files related to Assignment 5. New/modified files include:
* main.c - scullbuffer device driver source code.
* test.sh - shell script to run different test cases.
	
// Install Instructions:
1) Run make on local Makefile
2) Unload existing scullbuffer module: "sudo ./scull_unload"
3) Load scullbuffer device(s), choose whatever NITEMS buffer size: "sudo ./scull_load"

// Test Instructions: test.sh is a helper script for running through the 5 test cases.
Each test can be run by issuing "./test.sh <test-case>". To be explicit,
* Test Case 1 = "./test.sh 1"
* Test Case 2 = "./test.sh 2"
* Test Case 3 = "./test.sh 3"
* Test Case 4 = "./test.sh 4"
* Test Case 5 = "./test.sh 5"

Each test execution displays what producer/consumer commands were executed along with
an estimated pass/fail. For certain test scenarios, it is necessary to review the log
files to confirm successfull execution. As of current, all test cases succeed.

Detailed device operation is outputted to dmesg.
