Assignment 3 Part 1 can be compiled by running make on the included makefile. This build process will
generate one executable: prodcon.out. Prodcon.out can be executed from the command line and accepts
the following input arguments:
    - Arg 1 (required): Size of item buffer (i.e. maximum number of items that can fit in buffer)
    - Arg 2 (optional): Number of items produced by producer.

Example:

./prodcon.out 7 3333

will print...
